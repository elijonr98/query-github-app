# MVST-Github challenge

MVST-Github challenge is a React Project that lets the user query Github profiles. Specifically, it queries User's information and repositories. Those repositories can be filtered based on a text field to find the desired repositories easy.

---

## Running the app

Make sure you are in the root folder (mvst-app)

    $ npm run start

## Checking if the server is running

You will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/`



## Future improvements

Another feature that could be added to the app is to filter the repositories based on the programming language used (check boxes).
Furthermore, there is always room for improvement on the user interface. 

## Feedback

This exercise seems to be very effective for the student to show their coding abilities. It is short, but it covers most of the skills that are needed in production.
